### The Compounding Effect of Incremental Improvements

One way to think of an incremental improvement is cutting a sharp edge of a process, solution or problem.  A single improvement may not make a noticeable difference but in aggregate the changes can compound to transform a nascent idea to a viable solution.

We created this little visualization to help demonstrate it.  We hope you enjoy!

Example - The compounding effect of incremental AI coding improvements has made it now possible to build something like this just to illustrate this example!
